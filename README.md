# Technical Guides for Software

This repository is created for a university course and also serves as a way to practice my LaTeX skills. It contains LaTeX files that provide technical guides for various software.

## LaTeX Tools

We use two main tools for writing and compiling LaTeX documents in this repository: **TexLive** and **Overleaf**.

### TexLive

TexLive is a cross-platform distribution of the TeX and LaTeX typesetting systems. It includes a large collection of packages, fonts, and utilities for creating high-quality documents. We use TexLive with Visual Studio Code (VSCode), a popular code editor that supports many languages and features. VSCode has an extension called LaTeX Workshop that allows us to edit, compile, and preview LaTeX files within the editor.

## Style Guide

The file `style-guide.tex` defines the standards and conventions for writing any other LaTeX file in this repository. The file `style.tex` contains the style template that should be applied to all the LaTeX files.

## Usage

To use this project, you can either clone this repo or download it as a ZIP file. Then, you can open the `.tex` files in your preferred LaTeX editor and compile them to generate PDF files. You can also modify the `.tex` files to create your own documentations or guides based on the style guide and template provided. For example, you can change the title, author, abstract, sections, subsections, text, code, images, references, etc. You can also add new `.tex` files for different topics or software.
